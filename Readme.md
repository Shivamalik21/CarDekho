# DISCRIPTION:
We made a  demo of (car_dekho) website . we designed five pages (Homepage,emi,challan,and news related to car).
<br>
Mostly pages were made by using semantic tags like main, navbar, header, footer, sidebar etc <br>
Html tags commonly used were- Head, body, h1,h2,h3, div, p, section, footer, img, anchor tag, span, input, button, select, option, strong, form, table, td, tr, label etc. <br>
CSS properties like, width, height, flex display, background color, font-family, font-size, font weight, letter-spacing, color etc. were extensively used. <br>
Links were used for material symbols, material icons, fonts and font-awesome <br>
 We applied common header and footer for all pages. <br>
 In other pages we gave hover property like scroll div and image and increase and decrease size of button,<br>
 We made over website responsive at 600 max-width, flex property also used in making of pages. <br>
 Some icon also used during making like arrow ,search, <br>
 In hompage we used tranform property in which we move image 60' to y axis.<br>
 For responsiveness we used different footer and header .
 We gave header a sticky postion property due to this property header show's during scroll pages to y-axis,<br>
 We connect all the pages by using anchor tag.<br>
 For link icon we gave the link in header . <br>


 CHALLENGES FACED-
 1. Combining of pages on github <br>
 2. UI malfunctioning after cloning of code from other members of the team <br>
 3. Material icons and symbols weren't visible in cloned file. <br>
 4. Trying to implement common code made by other team members <br>
 5. Positioning of elements in sticky, fixed positions <br>
 6. Making of pages responsive <br>
